    <p> Welcome to my webpage. My name is John Delaney and I'm a Computer Science Student at  <a class="brand" href="https://www.dsstpublicschools.org/college-view-high-school">DSST College View High School</a>. Though my grades may not reflect it, I'm actually a pretty smart guy. My main issue is that I don't always do homework (which is really important don't let anyone tell you otherwise) and I tend to give up when I'm really stressed out. I've been working more on this negative trait and I think I've got it down now. At least, down enough?</p>
    <p> See me if you want to talk about Marvel Comics, Video Games, my various existential crises, or just general life stuff. Jokes aside, I actually do have a lot of ideas about life but people usually think I'm crazy when I start talking like that so I usually refrain from it. In general, I believe that life on Earth is impressive beyond words. Yet, I also believe that it wasn't destined to be this way. I won't get into further detalis to save you from having to listen to me, just look at the cool projects I've made over the course of this school year.</p>
